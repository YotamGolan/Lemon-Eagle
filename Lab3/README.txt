The text of your prompts are stored in the processor’s memory. After
assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings
are stored?
0x10010000 - 0x100101e0
What were the learning objectives of this lab?
Learn how to code in MIPs, a low level language, and familiarize ourselves with it.
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
I found MIPs to be oddly intuitive and rather easy. It was rather fun to program with such a low level programming language.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I liked it as it was actually. It's good as is.
What external resources did you use to complete this lab?

Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
A TA assisted me in understanding MIPs during the first lab section, I did not collaborate with anyone in class.
