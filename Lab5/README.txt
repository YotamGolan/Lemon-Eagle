-------------------------
What was your design approach?
Complete each subroutine in order it got tested by your tester. Unwise in retrospect
What did you learn in this lab?
Nothing I hadnt already known from lab 4. It was practice, not a learning expierence
Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
Issues with word alignments due to the registers constantly being switched, lab files being changed and updated as I was working on the lab.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Stop changing a1 and a0 around in their purpose. a0 should ALWAYS be first index and a1 ALWAYS be points, it kept swapping between the two needlessly.
What resources did you use to complete this lab?
Too much time that could have been spent studying
Did you work with anyone on the lab? Describe the level of collaboration.
No
