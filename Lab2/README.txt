Lab 2: A Math Game
CMPE 012 Spring 2019
Golan, Yotam

-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
More nuanced MML control and how to implement multiplexors and registers using only basic logic gates.
What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Nothing worked well, much like coding things must catch fire before they can actually function properly.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
The instructions of what the game wanted made me very confused at first. Calling it a game is a misnomer and should also be dropped as it confused me.
What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
(Not including course materials)
None!
Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
I worked with Gavin Cooke, no designs were shared but collaboration on desired outputs were discussed (IE what is a overflow, shared a table of 2-bits 4 bit equivalent).
