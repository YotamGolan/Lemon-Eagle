-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to utilize NAND and NOR gates to implement all other gate types and complex SOP/POS truth tables. I also learned how to use MML to simulate
simple circuit designs.
What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
My issues revolved around trying to figure out how to construct AND gate's and OR gate's exclusively out of NAND and NOR gates. The boolean logic behind	
it was difficult to understand at first. It became trivial upon a eureka moment that largely solved the lab for me.
How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I actually enjoyed this lab. It begins easy and quickly ramps it up and once understood isn't overly difficult. It tests and builds ones knowledge without 
devolving to busy work.
What external resources did you use to complete this lab?
(Not including course materials)
I used no outside material from without the class
Did you work with anyone on the labs? Describe the level of collaboration.
I did not collaborate with anyone.
