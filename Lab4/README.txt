Can you validly represent the decimal value 1098 with Roman numerals using
only I, V, X, and C?
No. Proper representation would involve the letter M. As it is over 1000.

Check that the letters are correct roman numerals. Then check that the basic rules of order had been followed. Then ensure that they were in numbered order.
